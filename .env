FIELD1_CAT=Factors such as age, activity level and health make a difference in what and how much a cat should eat. A cat need some fresh, clean water at all times, so you have to wash and refill your cat’s water bowls daily. Be careful if the food contains onion or garlic powder, your pet could be poisoned.
FIELD2_CAT=A cat rarely need a bath but you should brush or comb your cat regularly (even more if it has long furr).
FIELD3_CAT=To pick up your cat, place one hand behind the front legs and another under the hindquarters. Lift gently. Never pick up a cat by the scruff of the neck or by the front legs.
FIELD4_CAT=Your pet should have her own clean, dry place in your home to sleep and rest. All indoor cats need a litter box, which should be placed in a quiet, accessible location. In a multi-level home, one box per floor is recommended. Dump everything, wash with a mild detergent and refill at least once a week.
FIELD5_CAT=Your cat should see the veterinarian at least once a year for an examination and annual shots, and immediately if she is sick or injured.
FIELD6_CAT=Cats need to scratch! When a cat scratches, the old outer nail sheath is pulled off and the sharp, smooth claws underneath are exposed. Cutting your cat’s nails every two to three weeks will keep them relatively blunt and less likely to harm the arms of both humans and furniture.
FIELD7_CAT=12 - 18 years (depends on the race).

FIELD1_DOG=Puppies eight to 12 weeks old need four meals a day. Feed puppies three to six months old three meals a day. Feed puppies six months to one year two meals a day. For more information on how much you should feed your dog use our food calculator. When your dog reaches his first birthday, one meal a day is usually enough.
FIELD2_DOG=Dogs need exercise to burn calories, stimulate their minds, and stay healthy. Individual exercise needs vary based on breed or breed mix, sex, age and level of health.
FIELD3_DOG=Help keep your dog clean and reduce shedding with frequent brushing. Check for fleas and ticks daily during warm weather. Most dogs don’t need to be bathed more than a few times a year. Before bathing, comb or cut out all mats from the coat. Carefully rinse all soap out of the coat, or the dirt will stick to soap residue.
FIELD4_DOG=To carry a puppy or small dog, place one hand under the dog’s chest, with either your forearm or other hand supporting the hind legs and rump. Never attempt to lift or grab your puppy or small dog by the forelegs, tail or back of the neck. If you do have to lift a large dog, lift from the underside, supporting his chest with one arm and his rear end with the other.
FIELD5_DOG=Your pet needs a warm, quiet place to rest, away from all drafts and off the floor. A training crate or dog bed is ideal, with a clean blanket or pillow placed inside. Wash the dog’s bedding often. If your dog will be spending a lot of time outdoors, be sure she has access to shade and plenty of cool water in hot weather, and a warm, dry, covered shelter when it’s cold.
FIELD6_DOG=Daily inspections of your dog for fleas and ticks during the warm seasons are important. Use a flea comb to find and remove fleas. There are several new methods of flea and tick control.
FIELD7_DOG=10-13 years (depends on the race).

FIELD1_PARROT=An ideal diet for your parrot should be made up of 75-80% high quality bird pellets and 15-20% fruits and vegetables. Seeds and nuts should be strictly limited if not completely eliminated from your bird’s diet altogether. Although in the past seeds were thought to be suitable diets for birds, the nutritional needs of captive birds are different. A variety of fruits and vegetables is ideal (Avocados may be toxic, be careful).
FIELD2_PARROT=Your pet should be given opportunities to bathe, as a regular grooming routine will promote feather and skin health. There are different ways to approach grooming. A shallow dish of water can be provided. Alternatively, you may “shower” your bird underneath the faucet or mist it with a clean spray bottle of water.
FIELD3_PARROT=As with humans, exercise is important for your pet bird’s health and well-being. Here are some recommended exercises you can enjoy with your bird: Chasing, Climbing, Step-ups, Play ball, Dancing.... This will get the bird excited and jumping around.
FIELD4_PARROT=The ideal location for your bird’s cage is in a corner or against a wall in the room that you and your family spend most of their time in. This enables your pet bird to be part of the family even when they’re inside their cage. The reason you want to put the cage against the wall or in a corner is because it enables your bird to feel more safe and protected.
FIELD5_PARROT=The ideal temperature range for your bird is between 70 and 80 degrees F. Your pet bird’s cage should be placed away from drafts such as the direct line of an air conditioner or heating vent. Provide daily access to unfiltered sunlight and/or full-spectrum lighting. Birds need exposure to UVA and UVB rays from direct sunlight or full-spectrum lighting to synthesize vitamin D necessary for bone health.
FIELD6_PARROT=AVERAGE LIFESPAN: 40-70 years (depends on the race).

FIELD1_RABBIT=Rabbits are herbivores, meaning they eat plants. They’re built for a diet consisting of mainly large amounts of grass and leaves, as well as some flowers and fruits. Grass hay is the most important part of a rabbit’s diet. Examples of grass hay include timothy hay, meadow, oat, rye, barley and Bermuda grasses. Rabbits should have grass hay available to them at all times. It’s rich in vitamins, minerals and proteins and encourages healthy GI motility and the appropriate wearing down of teeth through chewing, and also decreases inappropriate chewing of other objects. Water should be available at all times for your bunny and changed daily.
FIELD2_RABBIT=The frequency of grooming a rabbit depends on their coat. Short haired rabbits should be brushed at least twice a week, while those with long hair need brushing every day. You may need to brush your rabbit more frequently if they are shedding.
FIELD3_RABBIT=Your rabbit’s backbone is fragile and can fracture very easily if the rabbit gives a strong kick, so it is always important to support the hind end. Never pick a bunny up by the ears because it’s painful for them and simply not necessary. It’s better to grasp the loose skin over the shoulders and scoop the rabbit up under the chest. Then, place the other hand under the back legs to lift from the floor.
FIELD4_RABBIT=A rabbit’s cage should allow them to stand on their hind legs without hitting their heads on the top of the cage, have space for a litter box and a resting area, be easy to clean, and be made of metal or another indestructible material. Cages should be kept in a cool and well-ventilated area. It’s not recommended to place your rabbit’s cage in the basement because it is usually too damp and could cause respiratory disease. Rabbits can be litter box trained very easily.
FIELD5_RABBIT=Pet rabbits should never be kept in a cage at all times. They need daily exercise to stay healthy, and to prevent physical or behavioural disorders. Rabbits should be let out into a larger exercise area to run, jump and move around for at least a few hours every day. They should be provided with plenty of toys for mental stimulation and to help wear down the teeth.
FIELD6_RABBIT=5 - 10 years (depends on the race/specie).

IMG_HAMSTER=https://www.jardiner-malin.fr/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Hamster-dore.jpg
FIELD1_HAMSTER=Hamsters do very well on commercial diets, pellets, or blocks, containing around 16% protein. Oxbow and Kaytee are preferred pellet or block brands that hamsters thrive on. Work with your veterinarian to determine your hamster’s caloric needs based on their size and health. Hamsters can be supplemented with additional fruits and vegetables, but these foods should not be the mainstay of their diet.
FIELD2_HAMSTER=Hamsters are nocturnal and easily scared if awakened suddenly. They do not have good eyesight, so it is encouraged to speak to them before picking them up. Hamsters will nip when frightened or poorly socialized. Hamsters may also bite if roughly handled, startled, or are feeling ill. To hold, owners can use a two-handed technique, involving cupping the hamster gently. Because of cheek pouches, hamsters have a lot of extra skin around the neck. A gentle but firm grasp of the scruff of the hamster’s neck can help restrain them.
FIELD3_HAMSTER=Hamster housing should provide at least a 15-20 gallon cage, with at least 150 square inches of solid floor space, or bigger. Wire cages, aquariums, and plastic habitats can be used as long as they provide a safe, escape-proof home for your hamster. Housing must be well-ventilated. Hamsters, with few exceptions, should always be housed alone, as they can be fiercely territorial and cause a great deal of damage to each other through fighting. Bedding should be changed 1-2 times a week with enough depth to allow the hamster to burrow and dig, especially under hides. Hamsters seek secluded, quiet areas for sleep, so hideaways are especially important within the habitat.
FIELD4_HAMSTER=Annual veterinary visits are essential to maintaining your hamster’s health. Your vet will perform a thorough exam, record your hamster’s weight, check for dental disease, and review diet and husbandry. They can also assist in trimming nails and catching medical problems early. Hamsters have an anatomical difference from other rodent species that can confuse their owners. Hamsters have raised, pigmented glands on their hips that may look like hair loss or tumors. It is always a good idea to have these glands checked by a veterinarian if they are not symmetrical or have other concerns.

IMG_TURTLE=https://nationaltoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Turtle-1.jpg
FIELD1_TURTLE=A healthy tortoise diet includes a variety of vegetables and some fruits for treats (no more than 5% of their diet). Regardless of what species you have, your tortoise should always have fresh water available. The water must be replaced daily since tortoises tend to defecate in their water sources.
FIELD2_TURTLE=All tortoises need a temperature gradient within their enclosures as well as a spot for basking, and either UVB exposure or, ideally, exposure to direct sunlight. You will need to monitor the temperature to make sure your tortoise won’t overheat. It’s important to install at least two thermometers within the enclosure, one measuring the warm, sunny area of the enclosure and the second measuring the cooler part. They should be placed at the height of the tortoise, and not above or in close proximity to the heat source.
FIELD3_TURTLE=The ideal enclosure for your pet depends on the type of tortoise you have. Adult Sulcata tortoises need much larger enclosures, with a minimum recommended size of 5x5 feet or larger depending on the size of your tortoise. For other tortoises, you can follow the rule of three times the length of your pet tortoise’s shell, by four times the width. Make sure there is a wading dish and basking area within the enclosure. Placing rough-sided paver stones and flat rocks near feeding and basking areas of the enclosure encourages natural wear down of nails and beaks. Enclosures can be placed either inside or outside.
FIELD4_TURTLE=Disinfecting your tortoise’s water dish should be done regularly to prevent bacterial build-up and/or illness.
FIELD5_TURTLE=up to 150 years (depends on the race/specie).

FIELD1_GOLDFISH=Goldfish are predominately omnivores. Flake food or a sinking pellet made for goldfish can be used to feed your pet. The food should provide about 30% protein for a goldfish. Pelleted food can last longer than flake food. Feeding flake food should be monitored as it often doesn’t sink. If a goldfish eats at the surface too much they can develop buoyancy issues.
FIELD2_GOLDFISH=Goldfish are considered a cold-water species of fish but can also be kept successfully at warmer temperatures. Fancy goldfish can be kept between 68-74 F, while some varieties such as comets or shubunkins can be kept in a wider range from 60-70 F. Often, goldfish can be kept at water temperatures that are similar to room temperature and do not require supplemental heat.
FIELD3_GOLDFISH=Good water quality is critical for keeping a goldfish healthy. The pH should range between 7-8.4 and temperatures should be kept in a narrow range. Water should be tested frequently and an aquarium should be cycled before adding any animals. Water aeration is vital to maintain oxygen levels within their habitat, which can be provided with an air pump and air stone. Filtration is also important to help remove any food items and feces from the environment.
FIELD4_GOLDFISH=Goldfish should be kept in the largest possible habitat available. Habitat size should be dependent on the variety of goldfish and the full-grown size of the fish. A goldfish, depending on type, can be housed in a habitat that provides about 10-20 gallons of water per fish.
FIELD5_GOLDFISH=10-15 years, up to 30 yers.

FIELD1_HORSE=A horse’s digestive system is designed to digest frequent, small meals of roughage throughout the day. The basic diet for most horses should be grass and good-quality hay, free of dust and mold. Clean, unfrozen water should be available at all times along with a trace mineral/salt block.
FIELD2_HORSE=Hooves should be trimmed every six to eight weeks. Depending on your horse’s activity level, the environment and his body type, your horse may need shoes. Your farrier will be able to recommend the best course of action to keep your horse’s hooves strong and well-balanced.
FIELD3_HORSE=Horses are social animals who are physiologically most sound when they have the ability to roam and interact with other horses. If your horse does live outside, make sure he has access to a safe shelter at all times. Unless it is very wet and windy, horses tolerate cold much better than heat and humidity. On hot and humid days, it is important to provide your horse with fresh water, minerals and access to adequate shade. In extreme heat, use caution and limit forced exercise. Likewise, during extreme cold weather, make sure your horse has access to shelter and the ability to protect himself from moisture and wind. Some horses may require a waterproof blanket for additional warmth. 
FIELD4_HORSE=Horses’ teeth grow continuously. Uneven wear can lead to sharp points and edges that cause pain and difficulty chewing. A horse’s teeth should be checked once or twice a year and “floated” (filed to make them smoother) by a veterinarian.

FIELD1_GUINEA_PIG=Guinea pigs are herbivores. To keep them healthy and happy, they need a constant source of good quality fresh, leafy green vegetables and herbs every day grass or grass hay, celery, endives, Brussel sprouts, bok choy and other Asian greens, and dark-leafed lettuce varieties, and herbs such as basil, coriander, dandelion, dill, mint and parsley. Remember that carrot tops should only be given as an occasional treat. small quantities of high-quality guinea pig pellets, a daily source of vitamin C, such as small amounts of citrus and kiwi fruits and a constant source of clean, fresh water.
FIELD2_GUINEA_PIG=Daily grooming is essential for long-haired guinea pigs, and ensures their coats remain in good condition. Regular handling will also help build her confidence, and encourage her to become friendly and sociable. You should also check the length of your guinea pig’s teeth and toenails.
FIELD3_GUINEA_PIG=Your guinea pig’s enclosure should be at least one metre by 0.7 metres, and 0.7 metres high. If you have two guinea pigs, they will need double this space. They will also need their own, separate sleeping areas, which must be covered. You must fly-proof the enclosure. Line the hutch with newspaper and soft grass hay to provide cushioning and prevent foot injuries. Do not use sawdust, straw or wood shavings. Remember that your guinea pig needs a soft, clean, dry surface at all times, or she can quickly develop foot problems. Clean her entire enclosure regularly.
FIELD4_GUINEA_PIG=Good cleaning and feeding practices will help prevent many common health problems, including respiratory infections and skin problems. It is essential to cover your guinea pig’s hutch with a flyscreen. Guinea pigs, like most pets, are also susceptible to fleas. Speak to your veterinarian about an appropriate flea treatment if needed. They may also suffer from mite infestations, which can cause discomfort, hair loss and itchiness.
